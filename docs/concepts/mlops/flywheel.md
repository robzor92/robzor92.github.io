The MLOps flywheel is the path to production for most machine learning projects.
You need to setup a flywheel to enable more data to be generated from your existing operational or batch services, and that data should be fed into the feature store, where it can be used to train bettter models. With better models, you should hopefully improve you operational/batch services, so that you attract more clients, who in turn produce more data for training models. And so on.
